# Internal Dev Docs

This folder contains internal dev plan and design documentation for features under development. Once a feature is completed and ready for external community contribution, this folder can be deleted.

Note: Before deletion, you can prepare official feature documentation, formated in `reStructuredText`, by rephrasing and reorganizing the content from these internal dev docs.
